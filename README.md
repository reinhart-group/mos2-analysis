# mos2-analysis
This project used machine learning to analyze the temperature dependent features of MoS2 thin film micrigraphs. 

# Objective
To classify AFM images according to their growth temperature and to determine the features associated with the growth temperatures using class activation map (CAM) and occlusion attribution.
